# Online Retail II - Complete Customer Analytics Project

## Project Summary

This project utilizes modern data science techniques to perform customer analytics, segmentation, churn prediction, customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis, and A/B testing on the Online Retail II dataset. All analyses are conducted in a Jupyter Notebook environment with a focus on visualization and modeling.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

* Which are the most valuable customer segments and what are their common characteristics?
* Which customers are at high risk of churn, and what factors influence this risk?
* What is the estimated future value (CLV) of customers, and which segments should the marketing budget focus on?
* Is a particular marketing campaign (e.g., discount) effective in increasing customer spending?

## Folder and File Structure

* `data/`

  * `online_retail_II.csv`: Raw dataset
  * `cleaned_online_retail_II.csv`: Cleaned dataset

## Data Dictionary

The following fields summarize the columns and their meanings in the Online Retail II dataset:

* `Invoice`: Invoice number (nominal). A unique 6-digit identifier for each transaction. If it starts with `C`, it indicates a cancellation invoice.
* `StockCode`: Product (item) code (nominal). A unique code assigned to each product.
* `Description`: Product name/description (nominal).
* `Quantity`: Number of items sold per transaction (numeric, int64).
* `InvoiceDate`: Date and time of the invoice (datetime).
* `Price`: Unit price (numeric, float64). Price per unit, in Â£ (GBP).
* `Customer ID`: Customer number (nominal). A unique 5-digit code assigned to each customer.
* `Country`: Country name of the customer (nominal).

## Libraries Used

* Python 3.12+
* pandas, numpy
* matplotlib, seaborn
* scikit-learn
* xgboost
* lifetimes
* scipy

## Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning and EDA**: Cleaning of missing/erroneous records, detection of outliers (IsolationForest), basic statistics and visualizations.
2. **RFM Analysis & Segmentation**: Segmenting customers based on Recency, Frequency, Monetary scores and visualizing the results.
3. **Churn Prediction**: Modeling and evaluating customer churn risk using machine learning models (XGBoost, scikit-learn models).
4. **CLV Analysis**: CLV prediction using BetaGeoFitter, GammaGammaFitter, XGBoost; reporting and visualization of segment-based outputs.
5. **A/B Testing**: Statistical tests (Shapiro, Mann-Whitney U) on segment-based groups and visualization of results.

## Setup and Execution

### Environment Setup (Windows PowerShell)

1. Python 3.12+ must be installed.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```powershell
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
3. Install dependencies via `pyproject.toml` (choose one of the following methods):

   * Using pip:

     ```powershell
     pip install -U pip
     pip install -e .
     ```
   * Using uv:

     ```powershell
     pip install -U uv  # if uv is not already installed
     uv pip install -e .
     ```
